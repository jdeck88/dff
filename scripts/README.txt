questions on updatePrices:
I basically want to control prices on my end... manage all products in a SQL database, update prices there and then push changes to the LL.
See working script.

1. how to handle if the pricelist is not checked for this product? (automatically add to pricelist)
2. how to handle price adjustment (set it on if it is off, and adjust the %)
3. Any issues to think about when employing this
